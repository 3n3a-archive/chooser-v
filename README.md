# Simple Switching in V-Lang

So I read about V and had to try it out for myself.
This here is the result of that _trial_.

## Compilation

```bash
v main.v
```

## Usage

```bash
./main FUNCTION_NAME [OPTIONAL_ARG]
- FUNCTION_NAME: name of a function defined in a _switch_ statemtent
- OPTIONAL_ARG: an optional arg to pass to one of those functions
```

### `Ex:` About Application

```bash
./main about
```

### `Ex:` Frame Text

```bash
./main frame "test text"
```
